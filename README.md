***Quotient***

Quotient is a productivity-enhancing iOS application built with React Native. The purpose of the app is to gamify personal progress by enabling users to create, modify and track tasks, aiming to improve their productivity habits.

Quotient enables users to:

Create tasks with unique properties such as name, description, color, category, and completion status.
Order tasks by their streak status and category.
Swipe right to mark a task as completed or swipe left to enable blinking status of a task.
View their productivity progress, denoted as "Satisfaction Quotient", in a visually appealing circular progress ring that displays the percentage of completed tasks.
Tasks can optionally support "Streaks" which are useful for tracking habitual activities. Tasks with Streaks are reset daily and if completed multiple days in a row, the streak count is prominently displayed. Additionally, tasks can be categorized with an associated emoji, and tasks in the same category are listed together.
